# Examples
You can execute each of this examples by running the following command:

```bash
cargo run --example <example name>
```

Alternatively, you can run the following command to run all examples (Linux):

```bash
sh all-examples.sh
```

**Running all examples is not recommended, but it's more functionality for just a few lines**
