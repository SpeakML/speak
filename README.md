<h1 align=center>Speak</h1>
**Speak** is a simple, easy to use Natural Language Processor (NLP) written in Rust.

<h1 align=center>Why use Speak?</h1>
Speak uses a custom engine, and to setup you just need two functions and data.
Speak doesn't use other crates, and itself is very lightweight, so it wont slow down your program. But while being lightweight Speak also is very powerful, with various default functions, and customization available.

<h1 align=center>Features</h1>

* The Rust file is very small, less than 4 KB, while being easy to understand, so you can even customize the engine for your purposes. (I recommend trying to customize the main function before modifying the engine for yourself.)

* A lot of customization and dynamic range, there is practically no limit, even with the default settings. (Unless you want to make a +131k index map)

* Custom map types, for optimization purposes. (Named Data and TranslatedData)
* Fully 100% Open Source.

* Multithreaded (Soon)
* Easy setup

Currently Speak is not published, and is in Beta, please don't use it.
