###### Currently Speak is in development, and it's not ready for use or published.

# Speak
Speak is a **Chatbot based in machine-learning**, which can be used to **interact with the user**. The philosophy of the project is to **make the user feel like they are talking to a real person**, and the way Speak does that is by being very fast, that's it.

## Features
Speak is very simple to use by design, that's the reason it has only a few public objects and functions. The features you're going to use are:

- `Map<T>` (Struct)
- `Learn(...)`
- `Run(...)`

**That's it**, you can use Speak with just two functions! These two functions are just normal functions, and you can use them in any way you want. If you want to know more, check the wiki, [clicking this link](https://github.com/blyxyas/speak/wiki) or with your favorite IDE documentation tool. (All docs are integrated in the crate.)

## Why is Speak so fast?

Firstly, Speak is written in Rust, with just a few hundred lines of code, with 0 dependencies and just two files (the main library and the utils library.), Secondly, it's written in the (realisticly) most efficient and strict way possible.

## When will Speak be ready?

I cannot know when Speak will be ready, but I can promise that it will be ready soon. I'm trying to make it the most perfect tool I can, that's why I'm taking a lot of time to make it.
