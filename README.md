###### Currently Speak is in early development, it wont execute correctly, it isn't even with all functions.
<h1 align=center> Speak </h1>
Speak is a Natural Language Processor Bot / Conversational Bot written in Rust (But with plans to expand to other languages).<br>
Speak is the tool to use if you want to:

* Have a bot to talk.
* Assist your users without sounding robotic.
* Experiment.

<h2 align=center> ‚öôÔ∏è Installation </h2>

Currently **Speak isn't published**.

<h2 align=center> üíª Usage </h2>

Using Speak is very simple, because you just need to know about two functions and a struct. (Being public ***just*** the necessary interface you'll use.)
Currently I cannot put example of the functions because they'll change. (At the same time the programming is happening, the design also changes.)
